<h1>Uses of computers and laptop</h1>
<p class="intro"> Importance of computers and laptops in modern times In the modern times, laptops and computers have become the most used items in the human world. Be it home, office, college, shop or any other commercial unit, these devices are in frequent use for multiple purposes. These devices play vital role in our everyday life and are of great help. They store huge amount of data, are easy to use and handle, and perform many functions that have made the life of students and professionals easy. However, it is not feasible for everyone to buy a new computer or laptop. Also there are companies that require these devices for a specific duration of time while organizing seminars and conference</p>
<h2>Advantages of computers and laptop</h2>
<p>Portability

Laptops give you the components of a desktop computer packed into a portable unit that you can take anywhere. Working on the move, away from the office or at a different desk is a lot more convenient when using a laptop than a desktop. However, in terms of size and weight, tablets offer even more portability than laptops.</p>
